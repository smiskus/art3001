        <p>The Outer Banks! You specifically requested to go here after spending <a href="../plane/beach.html">Spring Break in Florida.</a>
        You remember coming here as a kid and watching the sunsets from Kitty Hawk Dunes. 
        Turns out, you still want to fly a kite from the top of them. You spend a week discovering lighthouses, walking along the beach, and relaxing.
