        <p>It's the first time you've ever been to Chicago (and you unfortunately haven't been back since). You really wanted to visit here because you had just read the Divergent series which takes place in this city. You went on the Ferris Wheel at the pier, took a boat ride, and visited the science museum. The most memorable thing was going to the top floor of the John Hancock Center and looking out across the city. You could stay up there all day.
