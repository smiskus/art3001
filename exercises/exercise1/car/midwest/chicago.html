        <p>The first time you've ever been to Chicago (and you unfortunately haven't been back since). You really wanted to visit here because you had just read the Divergent series which takes places in Chicago. You went on the Ferris Wheel, a boat ride, and visited the science museum. The most memorable thing was going to the top floor of the Willis Tower and looking out across the city.
