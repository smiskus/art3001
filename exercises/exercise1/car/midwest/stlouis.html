        <p>St. Louis is where your mom's family lives, as well as many extended second and third cousins that you barely know. You don't visit them often now, but you will in the future for Christmas and Thanksgiving. In the backyard of your grandparent's house, you end up playing ladder golf and shuffle board with your cousins. Your aunt and uncle always cook a feast for when you come, and you enjoy the company of family all around you.
