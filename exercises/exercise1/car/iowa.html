        <p>The summer in Des Moines, Iowa that you'll never forget. You remember all the way back when you flew into <a href="../plane/illinois.html">Moline</a> for an interview. This was your first internship, and it was a blast. You met so many great people, lived in your first apartment, and did everything possible. Every day was something new, and you finally went out of your comfort zone.
