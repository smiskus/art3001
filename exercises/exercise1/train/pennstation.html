        <p>You arrived at Penn Station in the heart of NYC. You haven't been here since you were five.
            The city amazes you with the endless stretch of skyscrapers and wide sidewalks. There's so many noises and people.
            You only have three days to do everything you want to, so you end up walking over 28 miles. You visit the Met, 
            Washington Square Park, Times Square, Central Park, Greenwich Village, the Statue of Liberty, St. Patrick's Cathedral, and Rockefeller Center. The city is so, so alive.
