        <p>It's crazy that we're already at the halfway point with seven weeks of school behind us. This whole semester, it feels as if time has flown by so quickly that I haven't been able to stop and smell the roses. It's easy to forget to appreciate the small things that I'll miss about college. Plenty of those things happened before quarantine, like eating breakfast on the Knowlton steps, running into a friend on the way to a class, or hanging out in the library with a raspberry iced tea. I never thought that I would actually want to be back in a classroom so badly. There's some things that I'll miss from this semester too, like my fellow ACM-W club officers, running on the Olentangy Trail, and my Capstone group. I've tried to make the most out of these semesters, despite the world being in its current state.</p>
        <p>As for this class, I'm excited to finally finish up Project 1 as I've been making steady progress on it over the course of three weeks. I've learned a lot in the process, like how to use jQuery, what styling is needed to make websites more responsive, and in general more CSS tricks I can apply to websites I make in the future. This project solidified my interest in doing frontend development, as I love working with visuals more than a mysterious backend server. Hopefully I'll be able to put these skills to good use in the future!</p>

        <p>I'm sure the rest of the semester will go by just as quickly as the first half. There are some things I want to focus on like taking breaks from school work, spending time with my friends, and walking around campus more. My friends and I actually made a bucket list of things we wanted to do before the semester ends, including having a scavenger hunt, paint night, and going to Hocking Hills. In total, we have sixteen things we want to do and have completed only four of them. It'll be fun to try and do them all, and definitely the best way to finish out the semester.</p>
