                <p>I'm the type of person who can get quickly sucked into a project once I start it. For example, I remember this one lab I had to do for my Systems class where I was so determined to figure it out, I spent the whole day working on it. Before I knew it, time had flown by and suddenly it was eleven o' clock at night. I ended up becoming so frustrated over a segmentation fault error that I finally had to admit defeat. The next day when I looked at my code, I found the mistake in less than ten minutes.</p>
                <p>I tend to get really invested in finishing something once I start it. It's hard for me to give up halfway through doing an assignment. That's why this semester, most of my time has been devoted towards my Capstone project and this class. Specifically for this class, I'll have a million ideas of how to style something and then spend the next four hours trying to implement it. I easily get into that "flow" state of mind. The same thing happens with my Capstone project--I'll think of a new idea for our game and want to implement it right away.</p>    
                <p>Surprisingly, I haven't had too many issues with getting my website to look the way I want it to. I'm finally learning about how to properly format CSS so that website designs are responsive. Last semester, I was working on a database website for my club ACM-W, and I had no clue how to scale things to fit on mobile devices. What looked nice on a fully expanded desktop was completely smushed together on a mobile screen. This class seems to overlap a lot with my Mobile Apps course I'm taking this semester where we're also learning about how to design the UI to be flexible based on different phone resolutions and orientations.</p>

                <p>While it may seem completely unrelated, I included a Taylor Swift quote since it feels as if my website is undergoing its own "reinvention" stage. I know that in the next few weeks, it will go through many iterations as I try to find the best styles for each page. I also know that I want to incorporate some JavaScript/jQuery because I feel like I never really took the time to learn it. It seems funny now since I have worked with things like WebGL (a JavaScipt API) and React (a JavaScript library) but never learned the basics. I'm excited to use code to showcase my personality rather than focusing solely on functionality.</p>
