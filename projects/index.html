        <h2>Project 1</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Project 1 was focused on designing the homepage of my website. Early mock-ups of my homepage can be found <a href="../exercises/exercise3.html">here</a>. For my homepage, I styled it after different Hollywood eras--black and white classic movies, the golden age, new hollywood, and modern cinema. Aside from the movie references, I added my own artwork throughout the years to showcase.</p>

        <h2>Project 2</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Project 2 was focused on expanding upon one of our previous exercises. I decided to expand upon my exercise 5 which was focused on transformation since I felt like the idea could be polished and taken further. Mock-ups of my final project proposal can be found <a href="../exercises/exercise6.html">here</a>. With this final project, I wanted to explore another js library such as matter.js. A description of the process used to create this project can be found <a href="../assets/Energize.pdf">here</a> and a video showcase can be watched below.</p>

            <p>This image is from my digital imaging class from last semester. The project was focused on creating a digital still life with Photoshop. It displays all my favorite things--books, colored pencils, popcorn, card games, and baking. I wanted to incorporate a lot of motion in the piece and bring elements of magic into it.</p>
